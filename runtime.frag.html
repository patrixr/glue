<h1>Lua Runtime</h1>
<p>Glue is built on top of the Lua runtime, which provides a powerful and flexible scripting environment.</p>
<p>We've configured the runtime to act as a bit of a sandbox, allowing you to run scripts in a controlled environment.
Many of the Lua standard libraries were disabled for this purpose, but we left those that we believed would be harmless in the context of Glue.</p>
<p>The available libraries in this sandboxed environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>base</strong>: This library provides the core functions of Lua, such as basic input and output, type checking, and other fundamental operations.</li>
<li><strong>math</strong>: This library includes mathematical functions, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and other common mathematical operations.</li>
<li><strong>string</strong>: This library offers functions for string manipulation, including pattern matching, finding substrings, and formatting.</li>
<li><strong>table</strong>: This library provides functions to manipulate tables, which are the primary data structure in Lua, allowing for operations like sorting, inserting, and removing elements.</li>
</ul>
