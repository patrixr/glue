<h1>Trim</h1>
<p>The trim method removes leading and trailing whitespaces from a string.
Itcan also be used to clean up multi-line strings in Lua scripts.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how you might use it in a Lua script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local text = [[
    This is a multi-line string
       that has inconsistent indentation.
]]

local trimmed_text = trim(text)
</code></pre>
<p>This would result in the following text:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">This is a multi-line string
   that has inconsistent indentation.
</code></pre>
