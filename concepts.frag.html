<h1>Scaffolding</h1>
<p>Glue provides way of scaffolding a folder on your behalf.
This is key to getting the LSP to work properly as it will generate the necessary files for it to work.
In the case of Lua, this means creating (or updating) the project's .luarc file to include Glue's definitions</p>
<h1>Blueprints</h1>
<p>Glue <strong>blueprints</strong> are a way to define a series of actions to be taken in a structured manner.
Not only do they allow for the execution of complex workflows, the also enable us to view, serialize and share those
workflows with or without executing them.</p>
