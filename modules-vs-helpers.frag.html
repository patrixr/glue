<h1>Modules vs Helpers</h1>
<p>The difference between Glue modules and helpers appears subtle at first, but it is important to understand the distinction.</p>
<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>Modules appear as normal Lua functions, but they do not execute logic directly. Instead what they do is <em>register</em> functions on the blueprint for it to be executed later.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Blockinfile({
  state = true,
  block = &quot;some file content&quot;
  path = &quot;~/.zshrc&quot;
})
</code></pre>
<p>This example script will populate a blueprint with a <em>Blockinfile</em> step.
Notice that the module starts with a capital letter, which is a convention to indicate that it is a module.
Now let's expand this example by using a helper function.</p>
<h2>Helpers</h2>
<p>Helpers are functions that execute logic directly. They are simple Lua methods.
For example, we'll use the <code>read</code> helper to dynamically load the content of the the <em>Blockinfile</em> module into the blueprint.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Blockinfile({
  state = true,
  block = read(&quot;./local_config.zshrc&quot;),
  path = &quot;~/.zshrc&quot;
})
</code></pre>
<p>This example script will read the content of the file <code>local_config.zshrc</code> and use it as the block content for the <em>Blockinfile</em> module.
But that is executed during the blueprint generation, not during the execution of the blueprint.</p>
<p>Meaning that the content of the file will be serialized into the blueprint itself.
This is a critical concept to understand, as it would theoretically allow us to run the blueprint on a different machine without the need for the file to be present.</p>
<p>By convention, helper functions start with a lowercase letter.</p>
